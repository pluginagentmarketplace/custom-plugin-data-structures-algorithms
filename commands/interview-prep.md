- **Round 2**: 1 medium + 1 hard (60 min)
- **Onsite**: 4-5 technical rounds
- **Focus**: DSA + System Design

**Key Topics**:
- Arrays, strings, linked lists
- Trees and graphs
- Dynamic programming
- Basic system design

### Startups
- **Focus**: Speed + fundamentals
- **Rounds**: 1-2 technical
- **Emphasis**: Practical problem-solving
- **Less focus**: Advanced optimization

### Interview Patterns by Company

#### Google Style
- Expect hard problems
- Need perfect solution
- Follow-up questions common
- System design may appear

#### Amazon Style
- Behavioral + Technical
- Medium difficulty mainly
- Leadership principles matter
- 4-5 round loop

#### Microsoft Style
- Multiple coding questions
- Focus on code quality
- Design/patterns important
- Behavioral integrated

## Daily Checklist

### Before Interview Day
- [ ] Sleep 8 hours
- [ ] Eat good breakfast
- [ ] Test technical setup
- [ ] Prepare environment
- [ ] Review key formulas/patterns
- [ ] Calm mind exercises

### During Interview (45 min)
- [ ] **Clarify (3 min)**: Ask questions, understand problem
- [ ] **Approach (2 min)**: Outline solution before coding
- [ ] **Code (25 min)**: Write clean, tested code
- [ ] **Test (5 min)**: Walk through examples
- [ ] **Optimize (5 min)**: Discuss complexity, improvements
- [ ] **Questions (5 min)**: Ask about their work/culture

## Common Interview Mistakes

❌ **Don't**:
- Jump into coding without planning
- Ignore edge cases
- Write inefficient solutions
- Forget to test code
- Stay silent (communicate!)
- Memorize solutions
- Panic if stuck
- Not ask clarifying questions

✅ **Do**:
- Ask clarifying questions
- State your assumptions
- Think out loud
- Start with brute force
- Optimize step by step
- Write clean code
- Handle edge cases
- Test with examples
- Manage time wisely
- Ask for feedback

## Time Management

### 45-Minute Interview

- 5 min: Discuss approach
- 30 min: Code and test
- 5 min: Optimize
- 3 min: Questions

### 60-Minute Interview
- 3 min: Read and understand

- Behavioral mixed throughout

## Mock Interview Tips

Use `/practice` with mock interview setting:
- Record yourself
- Time yourself strictly
- Ask a friend to play interviewer
- Get feedback on communication
- Review and improve

## Resources by Phase
