## Interview Day Strategies

### Before Interview
- [ ] Review 3-5 problems from expected topics
- [ ] Practice writing clean code
- [ ] Understand your data structures
- [ ] Have 2-3 test cases ready

### During Interview
1. **Understand the Problem** (2 minutes)
   - Clarify constraints
   - Ask about edge cases
   - Verify input/output format

2. **Discuss Approach** (3-5 minutes)
   - Explain your algorithm
   - State time/space complexity
   - Ask if interviewer agrees

3. **Code** (10-15 minutes)
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Consider edge cases

4. **Test** (3-5 minutes)
   - Walk through test cases
   - Check boundary conditions
   - Verify time/space complexity

5. **Optimize** (2-3 minutes)
   - Discuss possible improvements
   - Trade-offs between solutions
   - Real-world considerations

### Communication Tips
- **"Let me think out loud"** - Shows your thought process
- **"Can I clarify..."** - Asks smart questions
- **"My approach is..."** - Explains before coding
- **"Edge cases include..."** - Demonstrates thoroughness
- **"Trade-off would be..."** - Shows system thinking

## Red Flags to Avoid

❌ Don't jump into coding immediately
❌ Don't ignore edge cases
❌ Don't write sloppy variable names
❌ Don't forget to test your code
❌ Don't overcomplicaate solutions
❌ Don't stay silent for long periods
❌ Don't dismiss alternative approaches

## Green Flags

✅ Clarify requirements first
✅ Discuss trade-offs
✅ Write clean, readable code
✅ Test edge cases thoroughly
✅ Optimize time AND space
✅ Communicate your thinking
✅ Consider different approaches
✅ Ask clarifying questions

## Time Management

For a 45-minute interview:
- **2 min**: Clarify problem
- **5 min**: Discuss approach
- **15 min**: Write code
- **5 min**: Test & walk-through
