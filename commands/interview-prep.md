## Interview Strategy

### Phase 1: Clarification (2 minutes)
```
Ask interviewer:
1. "What's the input size?" → Algorithm selection
2. "What are constraints?" → Time/memory limits
3. "Can I modify input?" → In-place vs extra space
4. "What about duplicates/nulls?" → Edge cases
5. "Need to optimize further?" → Follow-up
```

### Phase 2: Planning (5-8 minutes)
```
Explain approach:
- "I'll use two pointers because..."
- "Time complexity will be O(...)"
- "Space complexity will be O(...)"
- Get interviewer approval before coding
```

### Phase 3: Implementation (15-20 minutes)
```
Code clearly:
- Write readable variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Don't skip edge cases
- Test as you code
```

### Phase 4: Testing (5-10 minutes)
```
Test with:
1. Simple example (n=1 or n=2)
2. Expected case (from problem)
3. Edge case (empty, duplicates, negative)
4. Large case (maximum input)
```

### Phase 5: Optimization (5 minutes)
```
Discuss:
- "Can we optimize time?" → O(n²) → O(n log n)
- "Can we reduce space?" → O(n) → O(1)
- "Are there tradeoffs?" → Time vs space
```

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Starting to code immediately**
- Take 5 minutes to understand and plan

❌ **Ignoring edge cases**
- Always ask about and test edge cases

❌ **Not thinking aloud**
- Interviewer should see your thought process

❌ **Pessimistic about optimization**
- Show you CAN optimize even if not perfect

❌ **Poor code quality**
- Variable names, comments, formatting matter
