# Difficulty Selector - Choose Your Challenge Level

Select appropriate difficulty and topic combinations based on your experience level.

## Skill Level Assessment

### Beginner (0-1 Month)
You are just starting your DSA journey.

**What you can do**:

- Solve simple problems (< 5 minutes if you know the approach)
- Recognize common patterns

**Recommended**:
- ✅ **Focus**: Arrays, Basic Searching, Simple Sorting
- ✅ **Problems**: Easy difficulty (1-100 on LeetCode)
- ✅ **Time per problem**: 30-60 minutes
- ✅ **Goal**: Solve 30-50 problems

**Example Problems**:
- Two Sum
- Contains Duplicate
- Valid Anagram
- Best Time to Buy Stock

## Difficulty by Data Structure

| Data Structure | Easy | Medium | Hard |
|---|---|---|---|
| Arrays | 15 | 20 | 10 |
| Trees | 10 | 15 | 15 |
| Graphs | 5 | 15 | 10 |
| DP | 10 | 20 | 15 |
| Sorting | 8 | 12 | 8 |
| Hash Tables | 12 | 15 | 8 |
| Backtracking | 5 | 10 | 10 |

## Daily Practice Schedule

### For Beginners
- **Time**: 60-90 minutes/day
- **Problems**: 1-2 problems
- **Mix**: 50% new, 50% review

### For Intermediate
- **Time**: 90-120 minutes/day
- **Problems**: 1-2 problems
- **Mix**: 60% new, 40% review

### For Advanced
- **Time**: 120-150 minutes/day
- **Problems**: 1 hard problem + 1 medium review
- **Mix**: 70% new, 30% system design

## Difficulty Progression Strategy

1. **Master Basics First** - Don't skip easy problems
2. **Mix Topics** - Don't do all arrays then all trees
3. **Spaced Repetition** - Revisit problems every 2 weeks
4. **Increase Difficulty Gradually** - 20-30 problems at each level
5. **Practice Similar Problems** - Pattern recognition improves with repetition
