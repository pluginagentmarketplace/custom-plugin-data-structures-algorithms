## Best Practices

### Do's ✅

- **Do start simple**: Easy problems first, build confidence
- **Do understand**: Not just memorize solutions
- **Do explain**: Out loud, to others, write it down
- **Do code**: Actually type and run code
- **Do review**: Revisit problems after 2-3 weeks
- **Do time yourself**: Measure progress
- **Do diversify**: Mix different problem types

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't memorize**: Pattern recognition > memorization
- **Don't skip explanations**: Understand why solutions work
- **Don't rush**: Quality > quantity
- **Don't isolate**: Discuss with others
- **Don't give up**: Hard problems take time
- **Don't use hints immediately**: Struggle first, hint last
- **Don't focus only on easy**: Progress requires challenge
