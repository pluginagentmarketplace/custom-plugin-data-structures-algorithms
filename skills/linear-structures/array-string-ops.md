# Array & String Operations

## Two-Pointer
Pointers at opposite ends, move toward center
O(n) time, O(1) space

## Sliding Window
Window slides across array, maintain invariant
O(n) time, O(1) space

## Common Patterns
- Rotation: Reverse technique
- Searching: Binary search O(log n)
- Sorting: In-place sorts
- Reversal: Two-pointer or stack

## Key Problems
- Two Sum
- Container With Most Water
- Palindrome Validation
- Subarray Sum
