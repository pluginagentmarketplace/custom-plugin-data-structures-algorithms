# Stacks & Queues

## Stack (LIFO)
Last In First Out
- Push: O(1)
- Pop: O(1)
- Peek: O(1)

### Uses
- Expression evaluation
- Parenthesis matching
- DFS simulation
- Backtracking

## Queue (FIFO)
First In First Out
- Enqueue: O(1)
- Dequeue: O(1)
- Peek: O(1)

### Uses
- BFS implementation
- Task scheduling
- Level-order traversal

## Deque
Supports operations at both ends
- All operations: O(1)

## Key Patterns
✓ Stack for recursion/backtracking
✓ Queue for BFS/level-order
✓ Deque for sliding window max
