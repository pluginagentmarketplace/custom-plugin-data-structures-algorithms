# Trees & BSTs

## Binary Tree Traversals

### In-Order (Left → Node → Right)
Gives sorted sequence for BST

### Pre-Order (Node → Left → Right)
Useful for tree copying

### Post-Order (Left → Right → Node)  
Useful for deletion

### Level-Order (BFS)
Breadth-first traversal

## BST Properties
- Left < Parent < Right
- In-order = sorted sequence
- Search: O(log n) avg, O(n) worst

## Key Operations
- Insert: O(log n) avg
- Delete: O(log n) avg
- Validate: O(n)

## Common Problems
- Lowest Common Ancestor
- Validate BST
- Kth smallest
- Path sum
