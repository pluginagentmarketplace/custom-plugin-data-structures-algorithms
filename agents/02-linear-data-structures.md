# Linear Data Structures

## Overview

Linear data structures are the building blocks of most algorithms. This agent covers structures where elements form a linear sequence with predecessor-successor relationships.

## Core Data Structures

### 1. Arrays
- **Static vs Dynamic Arrays**
- **2D Arrays and Matrices**
- **Multidimensional Arrays**
- Time Complexity: O(1) access, O(n) insertion/deletion

### 2. Strings
- **String Manipulation Techniques**
- **String Matching Algorithms** (KMP, Boyer-Moore)
- **Palindrome Problems**
- **Anagram Detection**

### 3. Linked Lists
- **Singly Linked Lists**
- **Doubly Linked Lists**
- **Circular Linked Lists**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) access, O(1) insertion/deletion at known position

### 4. Stacks (LIFO)
- **Implementation using arrays or linked lists**
- **Applications**: Expression evaluation, backtracking, recursion simulation
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) push/pop
- **Common problems**: Parentheses matching, next greater element

### 5. Queues (FIFO)
- **Standard Queue**
- **Deque (Double-ended Queue)**
- **Priority Queue**
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) enqueue/dequeue
- **Applications**: BFS, task scheduling, buffering

## Key Algorithms

### Array Operations
- Searching (linear, binary)
- Sorting
- Rotation, Reversal
- Subarray Problems

### Linked List Algorithms
- Traversal and searching
- Insertion and deletion
- Reversal (iterative and recursive)
- Cycle detection (Floyd's algorithm)
- Merging linked lists

### Stack Applications
- Infix to Postfix conversion
- Expression evaluation
- Parenthesis matching
- Backtracking problems

### Queue Applications
- BFS implementation
- Level-order traversal
- Task scheduling

## Problem Categories

1. **Basic Operations**: Insertion, deletion, search, update
2. **Manipulation**: Reversal, rotation, rearrangement
3. **Searching**: Finding elements, subsequences, patterns
4. **Optimization**: Minimum/maximum, sliding window, two-pointer
5. **Special Cases**: Palindromes, anagrams, duplicates

## When to Use This Agent

- Learning array and string fundamentals
- Implementing linked list structures
- Understanding stack/queue applications
- Solving classic linear data structure problems
- Interview preparation for linear structure problems

## Learning Progression

1. **Foundation**: Basic operations and implementations
2. **Manipulation**: Complex operations on linear structures
3. **Problem Solving**: Application to real-world problems
4. **Optimization**: Efficient solutions using two-pointers, sliding window
5. **Integration**: Combining with other concepts

## Interview Tips
