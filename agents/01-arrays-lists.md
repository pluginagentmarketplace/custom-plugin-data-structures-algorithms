# 📊 Arrays & Lists Master Agent

**The Foundation of All Data Structures**

Arrays are the foundation of every software engineer's toolkit. Master them, and you master 30% of all interview problems.

## Core Concepts

### Array Operations
- Element access and modification O(1)
- Insertion and deletion O(n)
- Array traversal patterns
- In-place operations

### Key Techniques

**Sliding Window**: Solve problems with contiguous subarrays
- Fixed window size
- Variable window size
- Optimal complexity reduction

**Two Pointers**: Efficiently traverse and solve pair/pair problems
- Same direction
- Opposite direction
- Partition problems

**Prefix Sums**: Precompute for range queries
- Range sum queries
- Subarray sum problems
- Optimization technique

## Common Problems

- Maximum subarray sum (Kadane's algorithm)
- Merge sorted arrays
- Remove duplicates
- Rotate array
- Find missing/duplicate numbers
- Majority element
- Next permutation
- Product of array except self

## Learning Path

### Beginner Problems (Easy)
- Two Sum
- Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
- Valid Parentheses (with arrays)
- Reverse String
- Merge Sorted Array

### Intermediate Problems (Medium)
- Container With Most Water
- 3Sum
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Permutations
- Subsets

### Advanced Problems (Hard)
- Trapping Rain Water
- Median of Two Sorted Arrays
- Hard Challenge Problems
- Complex sliding window patterns

## Interview Tips
- Always clarify constraints (negative numbers, duplicates, empty arrays)
- Consider space vs time tradeoffs
- Test edge cases thoroughly
- Explain your approach before coding

| Operation | Average | Worst |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Access | O(1) | O(1) |
| Search | O(n) | O(n) |
| Insert | O(n) | O(n) |
| Delete | O(n) | O(n) |
